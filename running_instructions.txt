Run Instructions:

Need to setup a virtual environment of Python 3.9.10 as that is the environment in which the code is run.
The API files are named after the task itself : priority1.py and priority2.py. The test files are named 
after the API file whose methods they are testing : test_priority1.py and test_priority2.py.


Testing Instructions:

To run all the tests at once, first install pytest using pip install pytest and then just write pytest 
in the code directory to get all tests to run.

OpenAI API:

The free API proved to be a hindrance, especially given that the prompt required to get the similar intents
was not very small and so it was hard to get the requests processed without being rate limited. When I figured out a way
to not be rate limited, my requests would process for an extremely long amount of time. In light of this,
I bought the higher tier API and I am happy to share the API key if needed.
In a real life project, I wouldn't be sharing this and even in my code, it is an environment variable.
